++ ptk

PTK is a game engine, also called a SDK (Software Development Kit) that helps you make your own games easily. PTK is a multi-platform 2D game engine with 3D capabilities built around OpenGL or Direct 3D accelerated hardware, however, it is also possible to create 3D multi platform games with OpenGL. (Just use the PTK framework to handle the multi-platform work and concentrate on the game!) It has been designed to be as simple as possible; PTK can be used by a wide variety of users: from the most experienced programmers to the newbie aspiring game programmers. If you can program in Basic, you can use it! It just requires a very basic knowledge of C++ and of course a C++ Compiler. If you fit the requisite experience just mentioned, PTK is for you. You can download the demo for free and test all its functionality to see if you like working with PTK.
